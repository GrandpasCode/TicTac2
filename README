Hi guys.  Thanks for getting TicTac2.  This should have came with
a compiled exacutable.  Please edit the Makefile for all of the
directories.  Type "make install" and it will install it to whereever.
To compile it your self you will need the ncurses library installed
in your system. If you want to change the computer's moves edit the
file ai.c. type "make clean; make" to recompile it. You'll have to run
"make install" again to install the new binaries. Don't forget to login
root before installing. Play against other users
doesn't work. Sorry.

Also if you have any questions, comments or other stuff drop me a line
at am256@freenet.carleton.ca  

P.S. If you have any information on how to  send messages to other users
please send it to me.  Thx.

Bye!
